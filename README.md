Simple Spring Project to demonstrate use of **Roo, Gemfire and Postgres**.

This PoC was started with following [this](http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/beginning.html) simple Spring Roo tutotrial, which uses the Hypersonic in-memory database as target database. 

DB configuration was then modified to use Postgres using pointers from [this](http://www.justaprogrammer.net/2011/06/25/moving-your-spring-roo-hibernate-project-from-hypersonic-to-postgresql/) blog post.

**Status as of 4/17/2012**  

- Project demostrates integration of Spring Roo, MVC & PostgreSQL. 
- Gemfire integration is in progress and not yet checked-in.
